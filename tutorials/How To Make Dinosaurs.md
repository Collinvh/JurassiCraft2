# Jurassicraft - How to make dinosaurs
```diff
- NOTE This process is subject to change. Jurassicraft is going under MAJOR reworking of how this system works
```
## Starting out
Before doing anything to do with fossils, you'll need a way to preserve them. The fossils have been there for millions of years, and are very fragile and will break if handled incorrectly. To handle the fossils correctly, you'll need `plaster and bandage`. Like in the real world, plaster is made from Gypsum (Pictured below, in game)

When mined, this will drop 4-8 Gypsum Powder, which is then used with paper and wool to make `plaster and bandage`. (crafting recipe below)

## Getting Fossils
Once you have the `plaster and bandage`, its time to start fossil hunting! Search through your world until you find fossils. The further you go down in the world, the older the time period of dinosaur fossils you will find. Once you find a fossil, DO NOT BREAK IT. As mentioned before, the fossils would have been there for millions of years, and will be very fragile. Insead, right click the fossil with  the `plaster and bandage` to encase the fossil, as to make for easy and safe fossil transport. You can now mine the encased fossil.

## Fossil Cleaner
Once mined, you'll need to clean the fossil. Theres going to be bits of rock and soil stuck to the fossil, which will make the results impure. To fix this, simply put the fossil in the fossil cleaner. The Fossil Cleaner will clean the fossils, giving you a dinosaur bone.

## Fossil Grinder
Now you have your dinosaur bone, the fun can begin. Get a Fossil Grinder, and place in the bone. Now the fossil grinder is very inefficient, and will often grind the bone into unwanted items, like bone meal or flint. There is a 16.7% chance that the output from the Fossil Grinder will return the soft tissue, the next item in the process. This means that 1 stack of bones will give you ~10 soft tissue.
## DNA Sequencer
The next step is to get the DNA infomation from the dinosaur's soft tissue, and put it onto a storage disc. The DNA Sequencer will do this. Put an empty storage disc along with one of the soft tissue in the machine, as pictured below. This will put the dinosaur infomation onto the disc. For the next steps, you will need to have a dna sample quality of 100%. Now it is possible to get a 100% sample straight away, its not the most likely, which brings us to the next process of combining DNA samples

## DNA Combiner
To synthesize the dna samples, you need to have a dna sample with 100% quality. To overcome this, the DNA combiner can combine two diffrent DNA storage disc samples, creating a new dna sample with a quality of the sum of the two inputs. (Meaning that an input of quality 5% and quality 50% would make an output of quality 55%)

## DNA Synthesizer
Once you have the DNA infomation, with 100% quality, for your dinosaur, put an empty test tube, DNA nucleoids (which you can get from smelting any potion) and your storage disc into the Synthesizer, and wait. It'll eventually combine into DNA. The storage disc will NOT be consumed in the process.

## Embryonic Machine
This step is very simple. The embryonic machine is used to take the dinosaur DNA, and put it into a syringe. To do this, you'll need a empty syring, perti-dish and the DNA sample from the previous step.

## Cultivator (Coelacanths only)
The cultivator is used for dinosaurs that would not lay eggs, and instead give live birth. The cultivator will imitate the enviroment needed in order for the dinosaur to grow. This means the cultivate needs water + nutrients. The water can be supplied with a simple bucket of water, and the nutrients supplied with food items. Currently, you only need to half fill all the nutrient types for the machine to be ready, however this, like the rest of the process, is subject to, and eventually will change. The slider under the water tank can be used to determin the dinosaurs gender, with yellow (left) being female, orange (middle) being random, and red (right) being male. Once the nutrient bars are half full, and the machine is filled with 2 buckets of water, place the DNA syringe you got from the Embryonic machine and place it into the slot. This will start the machine. Once done, right click the output item to spawn in your dinosaur.

## Embro Calcification Machine (Other Dinosaurs)
The embro calcification machine is used to insert the dinosaur dna into already living embryos, in order to be able to create a living dinosaur. All you need is an egg and the DNA syringe from the embryonic machine, and you'll get your dinosaur egg.

## Incubator (Non Coelacanths Only)
The Embro Calcification machine will give you a dinosaur egg. This egg is still in the early stages of life, and needs to be grown in an incubator. To grow the egg, but the egg into one of the incubator slots, and add peat moss for fuel. (You can find moss around the world). You will only need one block of peat moss per incubation. This will give you a hatching egg, which you can right click to spawn your dinosaur
